This prefab is a UI panel that lets players scroll through the list of connected players and teleport to one of them. There's also a "Hide me" option that removes you from the list globally.

--- IMPORTANT:
Drag and drop; no configuration required.

I recommend placing a single Find Your Friends panel in a place easily accessible from your world's spawn. That way players can freely respawn to access the panel again and teleport to new people.

--- LESS IMPORTANT:
You can place multiple panels in your world, but I don't recommend that for now, since references won't work as expected. I may add that feature in the future.

Udon Sharp is not required for this prefab. You can safely delete the FindYourFriends_us script and asset. They are provided as a fully equivalent alternative to the default Udon Graph asset.

This prefab is available on github (github.com/jokerispunk) and I'll be accepting pull requests eventually. I'm not an artist and an aesthetic rework of the UI panel would be welcomed.
